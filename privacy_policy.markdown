# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: May 6, 2025**

## 1. Data We Collect

- **User-Selected Text**: When you use shortcuts (e.g., `/xedit`, `/xreword`) or context menu options, the text you select or type is sent to OpenRouter’s API for processing.
- **Settings**: Your OpenRouter API key, selected AI model (e.g., GPT-4o), tone, shortcut prefix, and custom prompts are stored locally in your browser using Chrome’s storage API (`chrome.storage.sync`).
- **No Personal Information**: TextTickler does not collect personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, or IP address) unless you explicitly include it in the text you process.

## 2. How We Use Your Data
- **Text Processing**: Selected text is sent to OpenRouter’s API (https://openrouter.ai) to generate edited, reworded, explained, or summarized output based on your command and settings.
- **Settings Storage**: Your API key, model, tone, prefix, and prompts are stored locally to customize your experience and persist settings across sessions.
- **No Storage or Sharing**: TextTickler does not store your text or settings on any server. Data is only sent to OpenRouter’s API during processing and is not shared with third parties beyond OpenRouter.

## 3. Permissions
TextTickler requires the following Chrome permissions:
- **`contextMenus`**: To provide right-click options for editing, rewording, explaining, or summarizing selected text.
- **`storage`**: To save your settings (API key, model, tone, prompts, prefix) locally in your browser.

## 4. Third-Party Services
TextTickler relies on OpenRouter’s API to process text. When you use TextTickler:
- Your selected text and API key are sent to OpenRouter’s servers.
- OpenRouter’s Privacy Policy (available at https://openrouter.ai/privacy) governs how they handle your data.
- TextTickler does not control OpenRouter’s data practices. Please review their policy before using the extension.

## 5. Data Security
- **Local Storage**: Settings are stored securely in your browser using Chrome’s storage API.
- **No Server Storage**: TextTickler does not transmit data to any servers other than OpenRouter’s API during text processing.
- **User Responsibility**: You are responsible for keeping your OpenRouter API key secure. Do not share it publicly.

## 6. Your Rights
- **Access and Control**: You can view and modify your settings (API key, model, tone, prompts, prefix) in TextTickler’s options page (right-click the extension icon > “Options”).
- **Delete Data**: Clear your settings by resetting the extension’s storage in Chrome (Developer Tools > Application > Storage > Clear site data) or uninstalling the extension.
- **No Tracking**: TextTickler does not track your activity or collect analytics.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in TextTickler’s functionality or legal requirements. The latest version will be available at the URL where this policy is hosted, with the “Last Updated” date revised. Significant changes will be communicated via the Chrome Web Store listing.
